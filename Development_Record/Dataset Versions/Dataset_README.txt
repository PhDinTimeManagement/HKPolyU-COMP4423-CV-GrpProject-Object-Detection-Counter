To use the dataset, go to data.yaml file and change the test, train, val datasets path to absolute path first

Example
test: ../test/images
train: CanteenQ-Counter-5/train/images
val: CanteenQ-Counter-5/valid/images

Change to
test: ../test/images
train: ../train/images
val: ../valid/images

* Dataset V1 and V2 is discarded since they are only used for code testing.
